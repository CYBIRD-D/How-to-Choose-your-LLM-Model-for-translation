# How to Choose Your LLM?
**How to choose the right large language model (for translation)**  </br>
This post helps beginners pick an LLM that suits them.

### English | [‰∏≠Êñá-Simplified Chinese](README.md)
This article is meant to give beginners a first understanding of using LLMs for translation, with a primary scenario of translating visual novels (VN). Because the principles are the same, you can also apply it to other translation tasks.

## What are LLMs good at?
Compared with traditional Neural Machine Translation (NMT‚Äîtypically sequence-to-sequence/Transformer systems trained specifically for translation), LLMs don‚Äôt dominate on every metric. </br>

But they have clear advantages in several key areas, especially context handling, glossary control, and cross-lingual ability:

- **Stronger context handling**</br>
  Long context windows plus ‚Äúcontext-aware prompting‚Äù help maintain discourse coherence, resolve anaphora/ellipsis, and keep terminology consistent.

- **Glossary control**</br>
  LLMs understand instruction-style constraints (terminology/register/tone/pronouns). For VN translation (or any task needing context understanding), they often feel better overall than traditional NMT.

- **Cross-lingual ability**</br>
  Thanks to pretraining (good cross-lingual transfer and multi-domain generalization), newer LLMs more readily support multiple languages.


## How to choose an LLM? Online vs Local
What you choose depends on your needs and trade-offs across the following factors. Here‚Äôs a quick guide:</br>

- Only Want to use local models but unsure about the usage: [**LLM VRAM USAGE LISTS**](OtherModels_gguf.md) 

<details>
  <summary>Speed / Price / Performance  </br>
  "CUDA out of money, pls chargeüí∏"</summary>   </br>
  
LLMs can be:
- **Local models**
- **Online models**
  - **Official APIs** (online)
  - **Third-party hosted APIs** (online)
  
Local (self-hosted) means you run the LLM on your own PC/server.

How big a model you can run depends on **GPU memory bandwidth / VRAM size / compute**.
  
- Whether **local** or **online API**, there are cost trade-offs. </br>
  Local needs a GPU; online APIs are pay-as-you-go. Prices depend on model size and your token usage.</br>
Bigger model / faster speed = better quality = more VRAM + more CUDA cores = higher API cost
  - Google offers a **free-tier API**. Gemini 2.0 Flash is usually stronger than ~70% of small open models, but comes with quota limits. Bigger models = tighter limits.</br>

- If you don‚Äôt have an 8GB+ GPU (6GB is often the bare minimum; Mac: 16GB unified memory), **consider** [**Free API**](Freellmapi.md)
  - There are similar third-party platforms in CN providing some free tokens.
  - The author hasn‚Äôt used AMD AI Max+ 395 series, compatibility/perf unknown.
    - Design is similar to Mac unified memory but with lower bandwidth (vs M3) and insufficient compute to fully exploit 128GB.

- With a 6GB+ VRAM GPU you can try local deployment.
    - See **Open-weight/Open-source locally ‚Äî Quantization & VRAM guide** below.
      - For **Less or more VRAM**, also see [**LLM VRAM USAGE LISTS**](OtherModels_gguf.md) 
        - Usually, <4B models struggle to keep translation quality; 8B is a good ‚Äúsweet spot.‚Äù

 </details>

 <details>
  <summary>Privacy / Moderation</summary>  

  -  **Local models**: generally no privacy leakage (runs on your machine). Only moderation remains (you can choose fine-tuned models to avoid it).
  -  **Google AI Studio / free-tier [API](Freellmapi.md)**: privacy isn‚Äôt a concern because there‚Äôs no private data to protect here (joke). Google states free-tier data may be used for training; there‚Äôs no opt-out.
  -  **Paid APIs**: true E2EE is not feasible yet. TEE/Confidential Computing (CC-ON) depends on the cloud provider.
      - Most providers offer transport + at-rest encryption; plaintext is visible server-side. They promise to protect and regularly delete your data, and provide opt-out from training.
      - Moderation exists. Newer models are typically stricter (more advanced safety). Official APIs are usually stricter than third-party hosts.
  - **Third-party hosted open-source models**: you can choose fine-tuned variants that reduce/disable moderation (platform-level moderation unknown).
</details>

 <details>
  <summary>Multilingual / Cross-lingual ability</summary>  
   
  - Multilingual strength depends on the base model‚Äôs corpus, size, and training techniques.
    - Domain-/language-tuned models reinforce certain areas vs their base model.</br>
      - Example: [SakuraLLM](https://github.com/SakuraLLM/SakuraLLM) continues pretraining and fine-tuning on general Japanese and light-novel/Galgame bilingual (ZH-JA) data; it improves those domains sharply but degrades in other domains/languages, losing many of the base model (Qwen2.5) capabilities. Best used for translation tasks.
</details>

<details> 
  <summary>Thinking models</summary>  
  
  - ‚ÄúThinking‚Äù mode strengthens contextual understanding and instruction following.</br>
    In theory it yields better whole-document translation when context linkage matters (vs non-thinking mode).
    - Quality still depends on the training corpus.
  - But it‚Äôs slower, and chain-of-thought consumes lots of tokens‚Äîusually not ideal for real-time translation.

### Closed-source models

<details> 
  <summary>Price</br>
Different models have different prices</summary>  

Using a $10 usage budget on Gemini official API as a quick estimate:

| Feature       | 2.5 Pro | 2.5 Flash | 2.5 Flash-Lite |
| :----------- | :-----: | :-------: | :------------: |
| Input limit (or) | ~8M | ~33.3M | ~100M |
| Output limit | ~1M | ~4M | ~25M |
| Cost = input tokens * unit price + output tokens * unit price |

1. Thinking tokens not included here  
2. 100 tokens ‚âà 75 English words  
3. Or assume a small chat-style call ‚âà 1,000 input + 500 output tokens per call.</br>
2.5 Pro: ‚âà 1,600 calls</br>
2.5 Flash: ‚âà 6,450 calls</br>
2.5 Flash-Lite or 2.0 Flash: ‚âà 33,000 calls</br>

> Google provides a free-tier API.  
> But it‚Äôs limited by:
> - Requests per minute (RPM)
> - Tokens per minute (TPM)
> - Requests per day (RPD)  
> Daily quota resets at midnight Pacific Time.

| Model                  | Official API free-tier (baseline)         | Common/observed limits in AI Studio |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Gemini 2.5 Pro         | 5 RPM / 250k TPM / 100 RPD                | Not consistently shown              |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash       | 10 RPM / 250k TPM / 250 RPD               | Often 10 RPM / 500 RPD; some use-cases dropped to 250 RPD since 2025-06 |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite  | 15 RPM / 250k TPM / 1000 RPD              | Often 15 RPM / 500 RPD              |
| Gemini 2.0 Flash       | 15 RPM / 1M TPM / 200 RPD                 | Often 15 RPM / 1500 RPD             |
| Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite  | 30 RPM / 1M TPM / 200 RPD                 | Often 30 RPM / 1500 RPD             |

\* AI Studio vs API: AI Studio usage is ‚Äúfree forever,‚Äù but its UI quotas don‚Äôt always match the API docs exactly; Google adjusts them periodically (e.g., 2.5 Flash RPD observed dropping from 500 to 250).

  <summary>Performance</br>  
New closed-source models outperform open models in many areas</summary>  
  
Representatives (as of 2025/08):
  - xAI (Grok-4)
  - OpenAI (GPT-5)
  - Google (Gemini 2.5 Pro)
  - Anthropic (Claude 4)</br>
  Within a family, larger models are stronger (Gemini 2.5 Pro > Flash > Lite).

### Open-weight / Open-source local models
- **What ‚Äúopen-source / open-weight‚Äù means**
  - Today, ‚Äúopen-source models‚Äù usually means **open-weight**.  </br>
  - **Open-weight**: the model weights are released; anyone can use/modify/fine-tune/commercialize them under a license (e.g., MIT). </br>
  - **Truly open-source**: training/inference code & pipeline, model architecture, weights, and data sources are published, sufficient for full reproduction.

- **Where to find models?** </br>
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)  
  - CN platforms include ModelScope (È≠îÊê≠Á§æÂå∫).

- **How to read model names?** </br>
Example: **Qwen3-8B-Thinking-2507-abliterated-Q8_0-gguf** </br>
(This model name is hypothetical for illustration.)</br>

  - **Qwen3**: base model family
    
  - **8B**: parameter count. Common sizes: 4B¬±; 8B¬±; 14B¬±; 30B¬±; 70B¬±; 100B+
    - **MoE** models (e.g., 30B-A3B): 30B is total params; A3B are the active params.
    - For VRAM vs params, see **Quantization & VRAM guide** below.
      
  - **Thinking**: indicates a thinking-mode model (not all such models are labeled).
  
  - **2507**: time tag (2025/07), often minor updates.
  
  - **abliterated**: a style of ‚Äúde-safety-filtered‚Äù fine-tune; typically means moderation is removed.
    - You‚Äôll also see **uncensored, NSFW, amoral**, etc.
   
  - **Q8_0 (gguf)**: a llama.cpp quantization type. See:
    - **Quantization & VRAM guide**
    - [**LLM VRAM USAGE LISTS**](OtherModels_gguf.md) 
    - **Quantization types & relative quality**

--------

<details> 
  <summary>Choosing an appropriate parameter size</summary> 
  
  - Typically, GPU VRAM > model file size + context usage.
  - Bigger model √ó more data √ó more compute ‚Üí better results (scaling law).
    - For example: Qwen3-4B < Qwen3-8B < Qwen3-14B < Qwen3-32B
  - Common open-model size tiers: 4B¬±; 8B¬±; 14B¬±; 32B¬±; 70B¬±; 100B+
    - <4B models often yield poor translation quality‚Äîtest on Hugging Face if curious.
    - For MoE, consider the **total** parameter count.
> Note: A conservative VRAM estimate is ‚Äúmodel file size + ~1GB headroom.‚Äù Longer context or placing KV cache on-GPU requires more VRAM.</br>
>
> If you exceed VRAM (spilling into system RAM), speed drops sharply (except on unified-memory systems).</br>
>
> In theory, larger models translate better; family-to-family comparisons are tricky.

</details>

<details> 
  <summary>Quantization & VRAM guide (examples)</summary> 
  
Using Qwen3 GGUF sizes with llama.cpp as examples.</br>
Here we only discuss GGUF models supported by llama.cpp (deployable via Ollama / LM Studio etc.). (MLX is similar.)</br>

#### Qwen3-8B (GGUF)

| Quantization | Model file size | Recommended VRAM (weights + headroom) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Q4_K_M | 5.03 GB | ‚â• 6 GB |
| Q5_0 | 5.72 GB | ‚â• 7/8 GB |
| Q5_K_M | 5.85 GB | ‚â• 7/8 GB |
| Q6_K | 6.73 GB | ‚â• 8 GB |
| Q8_0 | 8.71 GB | ‚â• 10 GB |

#### Qwen3-14B (GGUF)

| Quantization | Model file size | Recommended VRAM (weights + headroom) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Q4_K_M | 9.00 GB | ‚â• 11/12 GB |
| Q5_0 | 10.3 GB | ‚â• 12 GB |
| Q5_K_M | 10.5 GB | ‚â• 12 GB |
| Q6_K | 12.1 GB | ‚â• 14/16 GB |
| Q8_0 | 15.7 GB | ‚â• 18/20 GB |

See more examples for other sizes | [**LLM VRAM USAGE LISTS**](OtherModels_gguf.md)    
\* *On Apple Mac (M1+), unified memory = RAM + VRAM. After subtracting 6‚Äì8GB for system/apps, the remainder approximates usable VRAM (many optimizations may need more memory).*</br>
\* *For MoE (e.g., Qwen3-30B-A3B): total params = 30B, all must load; A3B are just the active params.*</br>
</details>

<details> 
  <summary>GGUF quantization types & relative quality</summary> 

> Note: ‚ÄúQuality‚Äù here is an **experience-based** tiering of overall closeness to FP16 + common community metrics (e.g., perplexity/objective evals). The same quant level can vary by model/task. `_K` denotes newer K-quant; `_S/_M` are mixed strategies‚Äî`_M` is usually higher quality than `_S`.

| Quantization | Theoretical bpw* | Relative quality (vs FP16) | Typical use / advice | Notes |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| **Q8_0** | ‚âà 8.0 | Highest (near FP16) | When VRAM is plenty and you want FP16-like fidelity or rigorous evals | ‚ÄúLegacy‚Äù method but the highest-quality quant; negligible drop vs FP16 |
| **Q6_K** | 6.5625 | Very high (near Q8_0) | Aim for high quality while saving VRAM | K-Quant; better quality/size than same-bit legacy |
| **Q5_K_M** | 5.5 | High | A great 5-bit default; deployment ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù | `_M` prioritizes quality over `_S` |
| **Q5_0** | ‚âà 5.0 | Medium‚ÄìHigh | Consider only for old workflows | Legacy; usually worse than Q5_K_* |
| **Q4_K_M** | 4.5 | Medium (best among many 4-bit options) | Tight VRAM yet usable quality; common balance | Often the 4-bit go-to |
| **Q4_K_S** | ‚âà 4.5 | Medium‚ÄìLow (lower than `_M`) | When you need speed/smaller size in 4-bit | More aggressive mix, slight quality drop |
| **Q4_0** | ‚âà 4.0 | Medium‚ÄìLow | Compatibility/contrast only | Legacy; generally not recommended* |
| **Q3_K_M** | 3.4375 | Low | Extreme memory/edge devices | Noticeable degradation; not recommended |

\* *bpw (bits per weight) are approximate/official numbers; some legacy formats (Q4_0/Q5_0) have extra overhead not precisely specified‚Äîshown as ‚Äú‚âà‚Äù.*</br>
\* *Special case: Gemma 3 12B Instruct QAT is q4_0, but quantization-aware training (QAT) makes its quality/speed far above typical q4.*</br>

<details> 
  <summary>Which models are better to use?</summary> 

  - **In most cases, newer is better**: newer training techniques/more data ‚Üí generally stronger multilingual ability.</br>
  - **Bigger is better (within your VRAM)**:
    - Different sizes at different quant levels?  
      For translation, **Q5_K_M** and above show little loss. So, Qwen3-8B-Q8_0/FP16 < Qwen3-14B-Q5_K_M (for translation quality).
      - QAT (Quantization-Aware Training), e.g., Gemma 3 12B Instruct QAT q4, can outperform traditional q4 on both quality and speed.
    - For translation & instruction following you usually **don‚Äôt need Q8**; **Q6_K** and above are typically indistinguishable in quality.
  
  - **Language fine-tunes**: English is usually best supported (most data). Other languages depend on data quantity/quality and training methods.</br>
    Community fine-tunes (suffix like -JP) use Japanese data to significantly strengthen EN‚ÜîJA, but targeted fine-tunes often weaken other languages.
    > Due to uneven multilingual corpora, tokenizer effects, and limited capacity, the fewer the multilingual data and the smaller the model, the more pronounced this trade-off.
    
  - **Unmoderated**: If your content trips safety filters, choose an unmoderated model, e.g.:
    - Qwen3-8B-abliterated
    - gemma-3-27b-it-abliterated
    - Llama-3-70b-Uncensored
    - Dhanishtha-nsfw
    - amoral-gemma3-12B </br>   
    (Suffixes like abliterated / uncensored / NSFW / amoral indicate de-moderation; others include ‚Äúevil‚Äù, etc.)  
    Depending on technique, these may sacrifice some quality.

  <summary>Quick notes here‚Äîsee the link above for details</summary>   </br>
    
Using LM STUDIO as an example:
<p align="center">
  <img src="./LM%20STUDIO.png" width="800" alt="LM Studio screenshot">
</p>

1. **Context Length** </br>
Max tokens the model can ‚Äúremember/process‚Äù per run (prompt + generated output). Larger windows handle longer texts but require much more RAM/VRAM and compute; exceeding the true max can cause odd outputs.
2. **GPU Offload** </br>
How many layers run on GPU (llama.cpp `n_gpu_layers` / `-ngl`; `-1` or >#layers ‚âà full offload). More GPU layers boost throughput but are VRAM-limited; the rest runs on CPU.
3. **CPU Thread Pool Size** </br>
Number of CPU threads during inference (`n_threads`). More threads ‚â† linear gains; near physical cores/system default is typical.
4. **Evaluation Batch Size (n_batch)** </br>
How many tokens are fed in parallel during prefill. Larger batch ‚Üí higher throughput but more RAM/VRAM; semantics unaffected.
5. **RoPE Frequency Base** </br>
Controls rotary position encoding base frequency; sometimes increased for longer-context stability (model/impl dependent).
6. **RoPE Frequency Scale** </br>
Scaling factor for RoPE; used with the above for extending effective context.
7. **Offload KV Cache to GPU Memory** </br>
Put K/V cache and KQV ops on GPU to ease CPU/RAM pressure and speed up long contexts; availability varies.
8. **Keep Model in Memory** </br>
Avoid unloading weights between calls for snappier reuse; costs RAM.
9. **Try mmap()** </br>
Map weights from disk on demand; speeds loading and reduces resident memory. (llama.cpp uses mmap by default; can disable if needed.)
10. **Seed** </br>
Fix randomness for reproducibility.
11. **Flash Attention (experimental/optional)** </br>
A more efficient attention implementation that reduces memory traffic and speeds long-sequence inference; availability varies.
12. **K Cache Quantization Type (experimental)** </br>
Quantize the K cache to cut memory/VRAM with minimal loss; stability varies by backend/hardware.
13. **V Cache Quantization Type (experimental)** </br>
Same idea for the V cache; often paired with K quantization for long contexts on small GPUs.
14. **Speculative Decoding** | [**LM STUDIO intro**](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/lmstudio-v0.3.10) </br>
Use a small, fast ‚Äúdraft‚Äù model to propose tokens that the large ‚Äúmain‚Äù model quickly verifies; improves speed without changing the final distribution.
> In most cases, keeping RoPE/KV defaults is fine; some models are sensitive.
